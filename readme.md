# FilesPool

FilesPool is a simple web application that allows users to expose a local directory and provide a public URL for others
to download files from that directory. With this app, users can easily share files stored on their local machine without
having to upload them to a cloud storage service or send them through email.

3. Put the files that you want to expose in the files directory.
4. Start the server
